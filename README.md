## Predictive Modeling for Defect Reduction
#### Introduction: In the modern manufacturing landscape, minimizing defects is paramount for ensuring product quality, customer satisfaction, and operational efficiency. To address this challenge, data science techniques offer a powerful approach by leveraging historical data to predict and mitigate defects in production processes. In this report, I shall present a data science approach to predict manufacturing defects using a comprehensive dataset encompassing various production metrics, supply chain factors, quality control assessments, maintenance schedules, workforce productivity indicators, energy consumption patterns, and additive manufacturing specifics.
